## Design Choice

1. The design choice was inspired by love for dark screen. Hence the major color of the project circle around Black and White Coloration.

2. The movie grid was inspired by my earlier personal project on a clone of Amazon website. Thus the grid layout is flexible and accommodates any screen sizes.

3. Movie details design was inspired by this website (https://fmoviesti.top/movie/)
